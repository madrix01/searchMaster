Hello,
This is my Django Search project which helps in searching youtube video more efficiently.
For eg. 
I want get tutorials about django from "Tech With Tim", so i would search everytime "django tutorials Tech with tim"
Thus instead of searching everytime, I would simply create tag , "Tech with tim", on the "Add Tag" section, 
And then in search seaction i would write "django tutorial" and then select the tag "Tech with tim",
Your tags and search history will saved for later use....
Enjoy using this...
